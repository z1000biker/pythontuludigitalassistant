# Sample code for chatbot Application Notebook using Llama-3.1-Tulu-3-405B

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements the first stage of a chatbot using the Hugging Face Transformers library, Llama-3.1-Tulu-3-405B and Flask. The notebook demonstrates how to set up a web application that allows users to interact with a pre-trained language model.

## Overview

The notebook includes the following key features:

- **Flask Web Application**: A simple web interface for users to input messages and receive responses from the chatbot.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Utilizes a pre-trained language model to generate human-like text responses.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Users can send messages and receive responses in real-time.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need:

- A Google account to access Google Colab.
- Basic knowledge of Python and web development.
- A lot of disk space !

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab:
   - Click on the notebook file (`.ipynb`) in this repository to open it in Google Colab.

2. Install the required libraries:
   - The notebook includes installation commands for necessary libraries such as Flask, Transformers, and PyTorch.

3. Obtain a Hugging Face token:
